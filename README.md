## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project mostly to practice semantic HTML and CSS Styling. I tried to use CSS custom properties and Grid to style the final result.
I'm relearning to code since I tried coding in the past so my knowledge is a little bit outdated. I've been watching yt videos and doing some exercises at different sites like codewars or exercism to learn the new stuff. 

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable enough with semantic HTML (I come from a world where everything inside a div was a standard lol) and I'm pushing myself to learn things like Grid, Flex, custom properties and some kind of preprocessor in the future like Sass or a framework like Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's solution to a Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This helped me a lot to get myself going in the right direction since I was kinda lost at first about how to build my HTML around the content I need to show.
- [Midudev HTML Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nYLTiY5skU) - This is agreat video about HTML for people who are starting or trying to derust themselves (like I did).
